README – Student Grade Report Program
📘 Project Overview

This Python program allows users to input marks for multiple students and automatically calculates their grades based on a predefined grading scale.
It demonstrates the use of functions, loops, conditions, and dictionaries — essential concepts in Python programming.

🎯 Objectives

Use a function to calculate grades from marks.

Accept multiple students’ data using a while loop.

Store names and grades in a dictionary.

Display a final grade report at the end.

🧩 Features

✅ Calculates grades automatically using conditions
✅ Accepts multiple students' marks
✅ Handles invalid (non-numeric) input safely
✅ Displays total number of students entered
✅ Clean and simple console output

💻 Grading Scale
Marks Range	Grade
90 – 100	A+
80 – 89	A
70 – 79	B
60 – 69	C
50 – 59	D
Below 50	F
⚙️ How to Run

Copy and save your code in a file named student_report.py

Open a terminal or command prompt.
